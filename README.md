SmallMedium-Business-Bookeeping Is an app use to track the goods that are avaible. And SmallMedium-Business-Bookeeping have simple cashier feature for tracking the goods more accurately along with the transaction history and stock avaible.

## The story behind the App:
I used to help my brother at his store. At first everything seems alright but after a while, a realization of the way he looking for the godds stock hit me. Like he if someone is asking for one spcific Item, he need to go to check it in the back first and tell the customer if it's avaible or not. So I come up with an idea "Why dont we bookkeeping the goods that are avaible so we can just look at the goods availability" I took the chances and make the motto "Programming isn't about what you know; It's about what you can figure out" to life. In the first 4 days i just planning the workflow instead of code. The next seven days(a week) I figuring how to do this and that for the program to running perfect. However Bug and error is the part of code, so the rest of the time I'm debugging the program until it run perfectly and turn it into exe file.
